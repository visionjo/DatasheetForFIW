\section*{Motivation}
\subsection*{Why was the dataset created?} 
% For instance, was there a specific task in mind? was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
\noindent \gls{fiw} was created to provide images that can be used to study automatic kinship recognition in the unconstrained setting: settings vary across several characteristics (\eg pose, illumination, resolution, focus,), demographics (\eg age, gender, race), appearances (\eg hairstyle, makeup, clothing), and familial meta-data (\ie families of different sizes that consist of different relationship types). The dynamic nature of the labels allows for data to be parsed for various tasks and applications. Amongst the possible tasks, is the most popular kinship verification task based on face-pair matching: given a pair of facial images, determine whether or not the images are blood relatives.
\subsection*{Who created this dataset (\eg which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (\eg company, institution, organization)?}
The initial version of \gls{fiw} was created by Joseph P. Robinson, Ming Shao, and Yun Fu, whom were researchers at the Northeastern University's SMILE Lab at the time of its initial release in 2017.
